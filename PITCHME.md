Two primary outcomes of westward expansion were that Native Americans lost their homelands and settlers grew in population across the United States.

James Wilson Marshall was trying to build a sawmill when he saw some gold at the site of the construction place. After he found it, word got out and the gold rush in California began on January 24, 1849.

During the year 1849, James Polk announced to everybody that there was gold in California, in the hope to increase the population in California.

Throughout the time period of the gold rush, because all the settlers came to California, the Native Americans population decreased due to the space occupied by settlers.

People who were settled into the west were usually farmers. They shipped their products from the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans for shipping outside the country.

Thomas Jefferson thought that the westward expansion was one of the many factors that would keep the newly born nation running for a long time so he declared that the United States should purchase New Orleans and the land along the Mississippi River from France.

Because of the gold rush in California, the westward expansion was fueled and the United States was able to buy more land.

During the time of the westward expansion to expand the United States, the U.S. government bought what we call now the Mississippi Valley from France by agreeing to pay $15,000,000. Because of these outcomes, the population increased on the west side of America
